"""Metric definitions = DATA, not code. To add a metric, add one entry below.

Fields
  names          Phrases a user may type in a question.
  aliases        Tiers of report labels, strongest first. A row label matches
                 when it ends with an alias, allowing up to 5 extra words in front.
  exclude_words  A label containing any of these words is never used.
  region         "income" = income lines above expenses; "any" = whole statement.
  pages          "statement" = income statement/highlights; "any" = any page.
  search_terms   Extra words for BM25 search.
  fallback       Alternative metric and reason when no matching row is found.
  positive_only  A value <= 0 is suspicious and should be verified.
  volatile       Profit-like metric; skips the large year-on-year swing check.
  negative_is    Meaning of a negative value.
  note_override  A verified note value can replace the statement value.
